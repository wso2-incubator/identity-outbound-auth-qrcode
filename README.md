## Introduction

With the advancement of technology and the increasing focus on the quality of user experience, some businesses tend to
make a web version for their application, along with the mobile app. In these kinds of applications, a userâ€™s mobile
phone (with an active data connection) can act as a helper device to authenticate the user to access the web
application by scanning the QR code displayed in the web login screen by using the scanner in the mobile app.
Therefore, this QR code authentication will balance the usability and security without affecting user privacy.
